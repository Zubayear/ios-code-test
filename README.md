# ios-code-test
iOS code test for the Junior iOS Engineer position in ZS Solutions. Without going into details, this project require a POST request to login to the app and a GET request for the information. The information you get from the GET request is obviously json. I've used swift ```Codable``` protocol to get the required information. Then used that information to build a complex view like the second picture. Overall, this project will test you're knowledge on iOS Networking, Complex view like table view, custom cell making, User interface design etc. This was a super cool and a fun project which i needed to complete within 3 hours.
